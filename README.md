# RaspberryPi Temperture Fan Control
Control a Raspberry Pi fan based on temperature. Can now use settings in Raspbery Pi OS as outlined here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdjU_AVcZTA  

You can also use the script provided here, though I've had to install the full version of Raspberry Pi OS (even when running headless) to ensure the proper GPIO functionality is available. There is likely a manual way to do this as well, so I'd welcome any tips (hi@jeremyscook.com)
